This Project is an implementation of "Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in Unknown Semi-structured Environments", Hybrid A* together with Reeds Shepp Path for open space trajectory searching. Some part of code refers to Baidu Apollo, including RS path param calculation.

Results:

The trajectory points contains two parts. The first part is generated by grid search using Hybrid A* from the start point, while the second part is generated by RS path leading to the destination.

#How to use
1. Clone the project to your workspace.
2. "catkin_make"
3. "source devel/setup.sh"
4. "rosrun planner HybridAStarTest" for trajectory (or "rosrun planner RSPathTest" to see the RS path)
5. Open your rviz and display the rostopics. Use 2D Nav Goal in the toolbar to set a target.
6. Done.

#Params need to be set
1. grid resolution and XYbound can be set in HybridAStarSearchTest.cc, using SetXYResolution(), etc.
2. Other parameters such as vehicle state, step size, and penalty values can be set in HybridAStarSearchMap.h.
